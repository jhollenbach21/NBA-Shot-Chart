# NBA-Shot-Chart
In this project I worked with other classmates (David Dipietro, Ian Cann and Patrick Garratt) to develop in interactive basketball shot chart dashboard. We used plotly dash to create this dashboard. The dataset that we use is from 2004-2024 NBA seasons, uploaded by Dom Samangy on Twitter. This dashboard allows users to compare heatmaps of shot frequencies from different NBA seasons, as well as compare heatmaps between any two NBA players they'd like.
